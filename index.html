  <h2>publicis media</h2>
  <p>
    <br/>
    during the summer of 2017 i interned at a digital advertising company called publicis media.
    i worked on their bidding team, whose job is to write the software for their ad-exchange. the
    bidding team does mostly back-end development, so throughout the internship i was able to pick up
    on some c++ and bash scripting.
  </p>
  <br/><br/>
  <h2>web development</h2>
  <p>
    <br/>
    also during the summer of 2017, i took a 9 week long online web development course through codecademy
    to enhance my front-end development skills. this entire website that you're currently on is a result of
    that, and i'm hoping to eventually get into some freelance web development in the future as well.
