  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>
    <br/>
    I’m a third year Computer Science major at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
    I’m very passionate about my college and what I study, and I’m always excited to learn new things.

  <h1>Recent Work</h1>
  <br/><br/>

  <h2>Publicis Media</h2>
  <p>
    <br/>
    During the Summer of 2017 I interned at a digital advertising company called Publicis Media.
    I worked on their bidding team, whose job is to write the software for their ad-exchange. The
    bidding team does mostly back-end development, so throughout the internship I was able to pick up
    on some C++, Javascript, and the Bash scripting language.
  </p>
  <br/><br/>

  <h2>Web Development</h2>
  <p>
    <br/>
    Also during the summer of 2017, I took a 9 week long online Web Development course through Codecademy
    to enhance my front-end development skills. This entire website that you're currently on is a result of
    that, and i'm hoping to eventually get into some freelance web development in the future as well.

  <h2>Wegmans Food Markets Inc.</h2>
  <p>
    <br/>
    During my four years at Wegmans, I held many different positions that helped shape the worker that
    I am today. My daily job consisted of working in teams and learning about new products on the spot,
    so that I could better inform customers and help build relationships.
